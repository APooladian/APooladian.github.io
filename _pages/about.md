I am a Master's student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/">Tim Hoheisel</a> and <a href="http://www.adamoberman.net">Adam Oberman</a>. Presently, I am a Visiting Graduate Researcher at UCLA and a participant of the long program in <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/high-dimensional-hamilton-jacobi-pdes/"> High Dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs </a>.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of optimization, computational and statistical optimal transport, high dimensional statistics, problems in deep learning, and inverse problems. 

I have been graciously funded by the NSERC CGS-M, the FRQNT Master's Scholarship, the Lorne Trottier Accelerator Fellowship, and Mitacs.
