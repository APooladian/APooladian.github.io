As of Fall 2020, I will be starting my PhD at the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu"> Center for Data Science </a> at New York University! 

Currently, I'm completing my Master's degree in (applied) mathematics at McGill University, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/">Tim Hoheisel</a> and <a href="http://www.adamoberman.net">Adam Oberman</a>.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of optimization, computational and statistical optimal transport, high dimensional statistics, problems in deep learning, and inverse problems. 

<!-- My MSc has been graciously funded by the NSERC CGS-M scholarship, FRQNT Master's Scholarship, the Lorne Trottier Accelerator Fellowship, and Mitacs scholarship. -->
