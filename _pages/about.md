I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu"> Center for Data Science </a> at New York University. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of optimization, computational and statistical optimal transport, high dimensional statistics, problems in deep learning, and inverse problems.

For the duration of the summer (and maybe beyond), I'm organizing a reading group on Optimal Transport; see <a href="https://reading-group-mcgill.github.io/">here</a>.

Before joining CDS, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in (applied) mathematics at McGill University, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/">Tim Hoheisel</a> and <a href="http://www.adamoberman.net">Adam Oberman</a>.

<!-- My MSc has been graciously funded by the NSERC CGS-M scholarship, FRQNT Master's Scholarship, the Lorne Trottier Accelerator Fellowship, and Mitacs scholarship. -->
